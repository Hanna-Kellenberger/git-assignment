<h4>Statement of Work: </h4>
This project’s main objective is to design a website that allows users to autonomously build a resume using just a few inputs. An optional objective that goes hand in hand with the main objective is to collect keywords from job descriptions and match resumes. The main goal is to create a working and feasible website that can be used without failure or any major bugs.
